### Personal Website

[joeobarzanek.com](https://joeobarzanek.com "joe obarzanek website")

This project contains my personal website written with Go and is primarily just a method of familiarizing myself with the language.
There is nothing here that I wouldn't mind sharing with anyone. So, if you're interested in making your own personal website, feel free to borrow
any of these templates, layouts, or files.

This repo attempts to follow [these](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout "golang-standards") best practices for Go project standards.
